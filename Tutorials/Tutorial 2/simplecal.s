# The main program is to perform calculation as per formula: __??
# Note: A formula is a mathematical expression with variables. For this exercise, you need to declare some variables based on the calculation task.
# Variable and expression are standard and common terms in programming context. It's assumed you have understood them from learning Programming Fundamentals.
# places variables __?? ... __?? in registers __?? ... __??
